# EMOTION PREDICTION

This project implements the machine learning model, naive bayes classifier to predict the emotion in a statement. 

## DATASET

The data is divided into 4 classes or emotions. The classes are

1. Happy
2. Sad
3. Angry
4. Sarcastic

This data was collected by scrapping the web for statement based on the emotion.

The dataset is pretty small and affects the accuracy of the classifier. The point of the project was to implement machine learning models to train and predict emotions. More data can be collected to increase the accuracy of the machine learning model. 

The shape of the dataset is as follows



The data is not even with very few statemtns for the angry class.
